This code accompanies the blog post here: "Insert Blog Post After Being Published"

As for the SQL File, this is using the baseball savant data I scraped using the baseballr package. Either use this scraper or go to my repository titled "Savant-Scrape"
which is all the code needed to scrape all data from Savant between 2015-2020 (located in the R file). 
In reference to the tables "hit_by_row" and "pitch_by_row", those are tables I created after loading the data into my personal database which
can be viewed in the other repository under the SQL file.
